# Prediction-of-heart-disease-using-ML-algorithms
Predicted heart disease using machine learning algorithms. Analyzed the dataset, applied statistical and machine learning techniques, and evaluated model performance to predict heart disease. Conducted statistical analysis and implemented Na√Øve Bayes and Random Forest algorithms to predict heart disease, evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix and other metrics. Successfully developed and evaluated machine learning models that predicted heart disease, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in healthcare.
