* Situation: Predict heart disease using machine learning algorithms. Predicting cardiovascular diseases holds significant importance in clinical data analysis. Early detection measures will prove  valuable in making critical decisions for high-risk patients, leading to primary prevention efforts.

* Task: Analyzed the dataset and performed statistical analysis. Examined the distribution of each feature indivisually through univariate analysis using plots like histograms and bar charts. Examined the relationship between each pair of features through bivariate analysis using scatter plots. Calculated the correlation matrix to identify the relationship between the features. Features with high correlation can be used to select the most relavant features for modeling.

* Action: Conducted statistical analysis and implemented Na√Øve Bayes and Random Forest algorithms to predict heart disease. Gaussian Naive Bayes was used it has continuous values associated with each feature are assumed to be distributed according to a Gaussian distribution. An ensemble learning method, Random forest was used as it combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.  Model performance was evaluated using the following metrics:
    1. Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances.
    2. Confusion matrix: A table used to evaluate the performance of the classification model.
    3. ROC Score(AUC-ROC): Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
    4. Recall: The proportion of true positives that are correctly identified.
    5. Precision: The proportion of true positives among all positive values.
    6. F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
      
* Result: This project aimed to predict heart disease using machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest and Naive Bayes classifiers. The Naive Bayes model achieved an accuracy of 0.87, slightly outperforming the Random Forest model, which achieved an accuracy of 0.83. The results suggest that Naive Bayes may be a more effective approach for this task, but both models show promise for predicting heart disease.
Successfully developed and evaluated machine learning models that predicted heart disease, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in healthcare.
